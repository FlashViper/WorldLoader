# WorldLoader
Currently, I am working on the simple goal of creating a game development framework 
  that can easily and efficiently create open-world 2d games similar to Hollow Knight or Hyper Light Drifter. 
This is one of many attempts of mine to create a system of saving and loading worlds at runtime 

See LDTK for inspiration, but more customized
